# TensorFlow-Object-Detection
TensorFlow Object Detection is a powerful open-source framework for object detection that allows developers to identify and locate objects in images and videos. 
It was developed by Google and is widely used in a variety of applications, such as image and video analysis, self-driving cars, and robotics.

The TensorFlow Object Detection API is an open source framework built on top of TensorFlow that makes it easy to construct, train, and deploy object detection models. 
It provides a collection of pre-trained models that have been trained on the COCO dataset (Common Objects in Context) and the KITTI dataset (a street view dataset for autonomous driving). 
These pre-trained models can be used as the starting point for most object detection tasks, and can be fine-tuned to improve their accuracy for specific use cases.
